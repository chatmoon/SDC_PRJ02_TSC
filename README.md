This repository is the code and writeup of the Traffic Sign Recognition project. We apply Deep Learning and Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) to the task of traffic sign classification as part of the SELF-DRIVING CAR nanodegree program. The project is broken down into three steps, which are: Step 1 Data Set Summary &amp; Exploration, Step 2 Design and Test a Model Architecture, Step 3 Test a Model on New Images.
